# heating-device

This is an user-interface software for a heating device, allowing the communication between the PC and the heater. The hardware acts to hold at a constant setpoint the temperature in a thermal blanket by using a PID controller. More info about the hardware and technical specifications can be found in the microcontroller source file.

By clicking in 'Pair', you start the communication and allow the software to receive the temperature data. It will be shown in the plot. The setpoint is automatically set to 20Â°C. Increase it to turn on the heating.

By clicking in the Settings push-button, you can adjust the PID parameters and the max/min temperature. These specifications will be saved and automatically loaded when the software opens again.
